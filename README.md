# Webcam-motion-detector
This python program will allow you to detect motion and also store the time interval of the motion.

* I will create a motion detector that records when an object passes infront of a webcam. 
* The program will record the start time and end time of an object and store in a CSV file.
* Using data visualization the program will create a time-series graph that shows when the object entered the camera and when it left.
#### Requirements.
* Python3
##### Libraries
* [OpenCV](https://opencv.org/): Provides a real-time optimized Computer Vision library, tools, and hardware. It also supports model execution for Machine Learning (ML) and Artificial Intelligence.
* [Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/): A fast, powerful, flexible and easy to use open source data analysis and manipulation tool, built on top of the Python programming language. 
* [Bokeh](https://bokeh.org/): Makes it simple to create common plots, but also can handle custom or specialized use-cases.
