# Webcam-motion-detector
This python program will allow you to detect motion and also store the time interval of the motion.

* I will create a motion detector that records when an object passes infront of a webcam. 
* The program will record the start time and end time of an object and store in a CSV file.
* Using data visualization the program will create a time-series graph that shows when the object entered the camera and when it left.
#### Requirements.
* Python3
* OpenCV (library)
* Pandas (library)
* Bokeh  (library)
